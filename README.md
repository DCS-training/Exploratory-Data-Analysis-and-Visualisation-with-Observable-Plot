# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation with Observable Plot

## Summary 
This two-hour workshop will teach you how to follow an exploratory data analysis pipeline with Observable Plot, a new JavaScript library based on the [Grammar of Graphics](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149), that proposes a simple yet expressive interface to create powerful graphics easily shareable on the web. 

Observable Plot allows you to create many visualisation types, from a basic line chart, to slope charts, maps, contour plots, and more. It makes data visualisation simple, but also easily customizable, by letting you modify all types of encodings (colours, shapes, projections, opacity, stroke, etc.) with little effort using the same grammar. 

This focus on simplicity and expressiveness lets us potentially create many visualisations on different facets of the data, showcasing patterns and relationships present in the data that could showcase interesting insights. 

This is an intermediate-level course. You will need some familiarity with basic data visualisations and JavaScript. Some experience with programming (in any language) is also beneficial. If you would like to familiarize yourself with JavaScript prior to the course, you may want to work through part of the [ W3Schools JavaScript guides](https://www.w3schools.com/js/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction]).
